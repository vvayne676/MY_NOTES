### 2.6.3 随机变量
如果我们进行足够精确的测量，最终会发现这个星球上没有两个人具有完全相同的身高。 在这种情况下，询问某人的身高是否落入给定的区间，比如是否在1.79米和1.81米之间更有意义。 在这些情况下，我们将这个看到某个数值的可能性量化为密度（density）

In fact, with fine enough measurements, you would never have the same height when you wake up and when you go to sleep. There is little point in asking about the exact probability that someone is 1.801392782910287192 meters tall. Instead, we typically care more about being able to say whether someone's height falls into a given interval, say between 1.79 and 1.81 meters. In these cases we work with probability densities. The height of exactly 1.80 meters has no probability, but nonzero density. To work out the probability assigned to an interval, we must take an integral of the density over that interval.

### 2.6.4 处理多个随机变量
#### 2.6.4.1 Joint Probability
$P(A=a, B=b)<=P(A=a) and P(A=a,B=b)<=P(B=b)$
#### 2.6.4.2 Conditional Probability
$P(B=b|A=a)$
#### 2.6.4.3 Bayes' theorem
$P(A,B)=P(B|A)P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)$\
$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$
#### 2.6.4.4 Marginalization
$P(B)=\sum_A P(A,B)$
