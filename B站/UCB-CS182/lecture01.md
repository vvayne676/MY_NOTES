### lecture 1
1. function的本质是定义rules 即 循环 if switch
if the rules that describe how inputs map to outputs are complex and full of special cases & exceptions, it is easier to provide data or examples than to implement those rules.

2. what makes deep learning work?
    1. big models with many layers
    2. large datasets with many examples
    3. enough compute to handle all this

### lecture 2
1. different types of learning
    * supervised learning
    * unsupervised learning
    * reinforcement learning

2. p(y|x) p of y given x  p(x,y) p of x comma y
